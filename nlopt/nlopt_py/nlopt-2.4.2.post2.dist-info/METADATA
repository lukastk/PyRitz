NLopt
=====

NLOpt is a free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization, providing a common interface for a number of different free optimization routines available online as well as original implementations of various other algorithms.

The code is exactly as found in https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt/releases. NLOpt is compiled without Guile, Octave and Matlab.

This package is just a distribution of NLopt. The person marked as the author of this package is just the author of the PyPI package, not of NLopt. The post-release version corresponds to the version of the PyPI package itself (the actual NLOpt does not use that version segment).
