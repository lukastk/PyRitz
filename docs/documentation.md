PyRitz Documentation
===================

## Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using PyRitz to find the
Freidlin-Wentzell instanton of Stochasic Differential Equation (SDE). As an
example, we will consider the Maier-Stein system [1].

Walk-through through all the steps required to make a script that can find a
FW instanton.

Note also how to Using PyRitz to find a Freidlin-Wentzell instanton
