Allow other types of nodes other than Chebyshev

Bugs:
- Odd N acting strange
- The velocity interpolation might be giving the wrong result for Chebyshev points. Example: the ends on https://gitlab.com/rajeshrinet/pyritz/uploads/f092d1dd14477097957cdeb61c0185a1/image.png

Ideas:

- I don't think it makes sense to let the functional familys have dimension.
You should be able to specify what functional family you want to use in what dimension.
For example, if i work in polar coordinates, I might want to use collocation in
the r coordinate, and some sort of trigonometric expansion in the theta coordinate.
